# Race-Game
This is our project for physics II, in which we had to make a car circuit using bullet3D and OpenGL.It is inspired by the character form the famous cartoon series Phineas and Ferb, Perry the platypus.

The objective of the game is to reach the final goal, in which you can touch the goal and reappear at the beginning to repeat the circuit again. If you fall off the road, you lose, but you respawn again at the last checkpoint that was touched.
